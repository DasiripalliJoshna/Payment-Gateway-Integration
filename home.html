                    <h1>NO ONE HAS EVER BECOME <br><br> &nbsp &nbsp POOR FROM GIVING</h1>
                    <h3 >
                  GRIP Foundation has been started to support people with our helping hand in all manner like Education, underprivileged children, Senior Citizen, Handicap, Health and Community Development with a passion for humanity and Imagine a world in which children are free from poverty, live in happiness and have open access to adequate education. The initial programs those days included assistance to educational camps, relief camps and medical support. With this aim we are running some grass root programs and we will continue to launch new and innovative ways to follow our mission with the help our local resources. The initiative has begun and working collaboratively with local communities and looking also for international humanitarian agencies for their helping hand. We strive to further our ability to help children all across the world with education, and hope with increased funding the initiative will eventually expand towards our respective cause.
                  Children are the future of every nation. The vision and mission of Helping hand india NGO is towards our goal of overcoming poverty, and ensuring a life of dignity and security for the marginalized populations. In association with local Mandirs, Masjids, Gurudwaras, churches and ngos, Our teams serves the poor with practical programs that meet needs for shelter, food, clothing, clean water, education, medical care, sustainability, friendship, encouragement and hope.

                  Helping hand india NGO try best toempower underprivileged children, youth and women through relevant education, innovative healthcare and livelihood programmes.<br><br>
                  Sparks Charity benefits over 15,00,000 children and their families every year, through more than 400 live welfare projects on education, 
					healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 2000 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.
					Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the 
					end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights – 
					and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen. Doubtless, education is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. 
					But child education cannot be done in isolation.  A child will go to school only if the family, particularly the mother, is assured of healthcare 
					and empowered. Moreover, when an elder sibling is relevantly skilled to be employable and begins earning, 
					the journey of empowerment continues beyond the present generation.
